#____________________       Auxiliary functions


#' Auxiliary function: Grid of conditional probabilities
#'
#' This auxiliary function generates the grid of likelihood values for each tumor pair (rows) and each value of xi (columns): P(observed mutations | xi)
#' @param xigrid Grid of the values of xi, corresponding to its domain of definition. 
#' @param mutns Matrix of the mutations observed, with all mutations in rows and the cases (tumor pairs) in columns. 
#' The data are coded as 0=mutation not observed, 1=shared mutation (observed in both tumors), 2=private mutation 
#' (observed in one tumor only). 
#' @param probamut Vector of the probabilities of occurence for each mutation.
#' @return Return the matrix of the likelihood values for each tumor pair (rows) and each value of xi (columns). This matrix is called 
#' by the auxiliary function grid.lik, returned as a parameter by the function clonal.est, and used as a parameter by the function clonal.proba.
#' @export
